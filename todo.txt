Fantasy Saga Advanced TODO
--------------------------

===Left work at ==============

XML Map Loading Routines
Game_Map_State load_level() [in .cpp]
Maps are located in maps/example_map.xml (for the map xml)
and maps/example_map.png (for the map image)

Also waiting on response in Eclipse Forums
for java.lang.NullPointer problem
and for answer to Android Problem in Android Forums (bookmarked)



===============================

(Make sure camera smoothly transitions with player movement)

(Count frames per second and make sure they are 30 or above)

1) Add code to fantasy saga advanced allowing for it
to do all of the functions of the d-type build, except
for the tile maps, just use one large bitmap for the 
base/floor (character can pass over) and one large 
bitmap for the top/ceiling (character passes under).
Add two more layers, one for effects (top, clouds,
fog and rain), and one for distant background (mountains
or sky in the distance).

2) While moving, when player stops screen scrolling slowlyt
decelarates to a stop.

3) Character speed decelarates slowly when coming to a stop insteasd
of an abrupt stop

4) See technical document (on mac in fantasy saga d-type folder)
for more additions/details/optimizations
